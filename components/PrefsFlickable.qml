// One scrolling behaviour for every scrolling surface in Atmos.
//
// Left to itself a Flickable scrolls a touchpad about a pixel per event,
// which reads as the view being stuck rather than slow. Measuring it on a
// laptop showed the events arriving with a pixel delta of five to eleven,
// so the view was moving a fraction of what the fingers asked for.
//
// The wheel is handled here instead. Note that this is a MouseArea on the
// Flickable viewport and not a WheelHandler: a WheelHandler placed as a
// child of this Flickable never received a single event, while a MouseArea
// receives them.
//
// The handler sits on the viewport (parent: root), not contentItem. Flickable
// reparents children onto contentItem, so a z: -1 MouseArea there only gets
// the wheel where nothing else wants it. Nav rows, search hits, toggles,
// and sliders all have their own MouseAreas that would swallow the event.
//
// scrollFactor defaults to 1 so Input → Scroll speed remains the only
// speed control. pixelDelta already includes compositor scroll_factor.
//
// The nav list already pinned the flick direction and the content pane did
// not, so the two panes of one window scrolled differently. Pinning it here
// is what makes that consistent.
